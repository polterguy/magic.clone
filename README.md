# Magic Clone - Develop Magic locally

This repository serves one simple purpose; Which is to allow you to rapidly clone and be able
to debug all plugins in Magic.

Clone this repository locally, then run the _"clone.sh"_ file, and wait until it's done - At
which point you will find everything needed to run and debug Magic locally within your _"src/"_
folder.
